# Work day scheduler
The work day scheduler application enables an individual to plan out their day by inputting a task in a timeblock.

## How to use the application:

1. Click in a specific timeblock and enter the tasks to be completed during that time.
2. Save the task by clicking on the button on the right of the input field.
3. You can come back to your task any time of the day before midnight to see what tasks you has for the day. After midnight, the tasks will be deleted.

*The deployed application can be found here: https://veggiepilot.github.io/work-day-scheduler/*.
